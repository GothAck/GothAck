## Notable projects
- I wrote a [partly functioning X11 server in Javascript](https://github.com/GothAck/javascript-x-server) for giggles and learning how antiquated the X protocol is.
- I really need to finish my [ZeroConf Wireguard](https://github.com/GothAck/ZeroWire) project so that I can mesh my nodes on my local LAN.
- I hacked the remote display protocol for MicSig tBook scopes and [made a desktop app](https://github.com/GothAck/oscope)
